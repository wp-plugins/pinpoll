Select or create polls at PINPOLL.net and include them in your Blog to increase traffic and user interaction - it's free!

== Description ==
This widget can display polls from pinpoll.net. You may create your own polls first to include them or choose from more than 3.000 existing polls from over 20 categories, one of which will perfectly match the contents of you blog. Show specific or random polls and set a minimum sample size. 

It’s free to use! 

However, if YOU want to get paid for using it, just get in touch: office@pinpoll.net

== Installation ==
1. Download and unzip pinpoll.zip 
2. Upload the folder containing "pinpoll-widget.php" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
3. Activate the plug-in through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
4. To add a poll to a sidebar, browse to "Appearance > Widgets" and drag "PINPOLL" to desired sidebar. Configure the parameters such as a Poll ID for specific polls or the Sample Size for random polls and save your changes. You may as well select your preferred category. Language will be detected automatically.
5. To add polls to any post we suggest to use the Code Generator ("Settings > PINPOLL") to simply copy the generated code and paste it to your post. Experienced users may simply use and adjust this snippet [pinpoll]service_url,width,height,style[/pinpoll]

Some examples:
[pinpoll]https://pinpoll.net/bookmarklet/getBanner?id=3480[/pinpoll] 
[pinpoll]https://pinpoll.net/bookmarklet/getBanner?category_id=2&popular_min=100,200,450,margin:10px 0;[/pinpoll]. 
[pinpoll]https://pinpoll.net/bookmarklet/getBanner?category_id=5,200,450[/pinpoll].
